### Notes:

The JavaCV libraries are not hosted on the maven central repositoriy for this reason you will have to visit:
https://code.google.com/p/javacv/ in order to download the JavaCV libraries and build this project. 
This is also a good way to ensure the latest files are used, rather than shipping .jar files with the project

OpenCV is required to be setup on the host machine also. The following tutorial was used to set this up on the console
running windows 8:
